// Class encapsulating a mesh
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The mesh class splits the mesh into sub-meshes that only use one texture each.
// ** THIS VERSION WILL ONLY KEEP THE FIRST SUB-MESH OTHER PARTS WILL BE MISSING **
// ** DO NOT USE THIS VERSION FOR PROJECTS **
// The class also doesn't load textures, filters or shaders as the outer code is
// expected to select these things. A later lab will introduce a more robust loader.
